## Question
DFP6223 MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT â€“ PROJECT

Create a mobile application (form a group of 5 members). You are responsible to find any situation or
problem that arose around you and develop a real-world solution that has some commercial value.

## Idea
Just reincarnation of my older project but in an android application.

See at : [iSukan Web Application](https://github.com/fuadps/isukan/)

## What is iSukan?
i-sukan is a android application that reserves and books a sports good through online instead of fill the form on the paper manually.

## APK file download
[isukan.apk](https://github.com/fuadps/DFP6223-isukan-android-application/blob/master/Objects/isukan.apk)

## Notes
This application is not responsive at all since it is made in static size.

## Update
No update since B4A hard to understand and to explore since the community is not been helping too much.
